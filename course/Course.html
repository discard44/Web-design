				<h3>Class Reflection</h3>
				<p>Designing a website begins at the coder level. The coder must create a proposal for the website and it must include the style of the webpage to the content. There are many tools that are used to create a website such as HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript etc.</p>
                                        <p>In CSIS 1430 these languages were the source of the class. HTML is the foundation of a website in which, you can do some layout designing of the site from. But HTML was not built to design the layout of the page. CSS is what is used for changing the look of a webpage. Using one style for multiple webpages is one advatage CSS has over HTML. In HTML you can style a page but then it can be reused on a different page or element on the same webpage. CSS also has a lot to do with the websites activity as well, such as when you hover on a link and the background changes colors which I thought was really cool.</p> 
                                        <p>JavaScript is the backend side of a website, it is the stuff that is not seen or heard. It is what make web page simulation possible. JavaScript is a good way to fix layout issues that you are having on a webpage.</p>
                                        <p>Futhermore despite all the tricks I have learned in this class I believe the most useful skill that I have learned is how to find the information for web designing. In all my projects there was many research topics I had to look up. This skill is what I now use whenever I start a new project in any of my classes or even at my job when I need information about how to fix a specific part of a computer. The atmosphere in the class seemed very relaxed and fun when we were discussing new topic.</p> 
                                        <p>Below I have included some links to some of the projects I completed this semester and also a link to my final website.</p>
