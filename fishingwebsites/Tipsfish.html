                    <h3>Tip #1: Where to fish</h3>
                    <p>Fishing is a fun experience outdoors. People of all ages participate in angling, and have a lot of fun. Depending on where you live a body of water is not to far from your home. Before you go make sure to check online what the local fishing laws are in your area. <br></p>
                    <h3>Tip #2: Casting</h3>
                    <p>There are many types of reels that can be used to fish.  It is important to learn how to cast the reel you chose to use before fishing. </p>
                    <p>Push button(spincaster) reels require the least technique to cast. Make sure the bait is atlest 5 to 10 inches away from the tip of the rod > hold the button down > lift the rod up and behind yourself > accelerate forward > when you feel you are coming to the end of the throw, release the button. Send that bait flying. </p>
                <p>My personal favorite I call a veil reel due to the metal bar you have to lift to release the line. Kind of like lifting a veil over a brides head to expose the face. But it is also known as a spinning reel. Spinning reels are a little more complex than a spincaster reel. Although it seems like the same concept for casting it. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use your index finger to grab the line.</li>
                    <li>Flip the veil of the reel back.</li>
                    <li>When your ready, just like the spincaster pull the tip of the rod rod behind you.</li>
                    <li>Accelerate forward.</li>
                    <li>Release when the tip is straight up in the air to get hang time or just a little bit more forward to get less hang time.</li>

                    <h3>Tip #3: Setting the hook</h3>
                    <p>Setting the hook means to snag the fish in the mouth with the hook; so it can't break free of the hook.Like most thing setting the hook takes practice. There are a couple of ways I have seen people set the hook. 1. When you feel a bite you yank the rod straight up. 2. Same as the first except you yank it sidways. I haven't seen anyone one of them more successful than the other, whatever your more comfortable with.</p>
                    <h3>Tip #4: Choosing a rig </h3>
                    <p>A rig is just the way you tie the hook, weight, and/or bobber. There are many ways of setting up your rig. For setting your rig it depends on what works in the fishing spot. You can consult with the local bait shop, but seeing how everything is online now there is really no need. Look up your fishing spot using a search engine and it should give you all the information needed to fish.</p><br>
