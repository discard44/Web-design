                    <h3>Tackle Information</h3>
                    <p>Tackle is normally referred in association with tackle box, and in your tackle box are many different tools to help fisherman to fish. Such as Plyers, fish weigher, multi-tool swiss army knife. The main tackle items that should be in your tackle box are weights, hooks, bobbers, and lures. </p>
                    <p>Weights help keep your line on the bottom if you are fishing for bottom feeding fish. Bobbers are their exact opposite, they are used to keep your line close to the surface. Consider bobbers and weights when you find out the fish you are fishing for.</p>
                    <p>Hooks are a must when fishing because it is how you keep the fish on the other end of your line. The standard hook comes in many different shapes sizes and colors. Rule of thumb when choosing a hook size: the bigger the fish; the bigger the mouth; the bigger the hook. </p>
                    <p>Another thing you will see in a tackle box is a spool of fishing line. Situations that would call for new line are if you lost all your string from replacing your hooks, this barely happens. Sometimes your reel line gets loose and you have to take all of it off to replace it. My favorite was the time my sister's reel broke and the bait shop we went did not sell reels with line already on them.</p>
                    <p>I may be missing a few things but These are all in my tackle box.</p>
